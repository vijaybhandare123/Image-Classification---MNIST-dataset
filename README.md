# Image-Classification---MNIST-dataset
  Simple Image Classification using  - Simple neural Network on MNIST dataset .
  
  This is the first project i have uploaded on Github .
  
  Here , you can see the basic convolution neural network for image classification 
  
  Data loading , preprocessing , making train & test datsets , creating model , summarising the same .
  
  Then compiling the model .
  
  Checking loss & accuracy with the validation score .
  
  Finaly evaluating with Test dataset .
